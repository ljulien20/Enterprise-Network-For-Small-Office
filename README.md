# Enterprise-Network-For-Small-Office

<h2>Description</h2>
Design a network in CISCO packet tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments. 

1) Each department should contain at least 2 PCs. An appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in this network.

2) The ISP has given the network address of 192.168.40.0; all interfaces  should be configured with  appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask, and gateways.
 
3) All devices in the network should be connected using  the appropriate cables.

4) Test the connectivity between the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY department PCs; the DELIVERY department should be able to ping the PCs in the ACCOUNTS department.

Here I configured the router to be enbaled with each Ethernet cable going to each department switch to have them powered on and processed static IP addresses for each device after the switch: <br/>
